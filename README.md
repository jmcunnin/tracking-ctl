Megacities-TRACKING
===================

This is a project for the Megacities Logistics Lab at MIT that aims to track trucks based on GPS data.

The project is comprised of two major folders: an example folder that contains the basic structure of how the project should be made up and the python scripts used to track the trucks.

example\_folder: 
-----------------
Shows the basic structure required for the setup. Basically takes all of the unprocessed data input as CSVs and inserts it into processed CSVs and a sqlite database. 

To run on a \*NIX system, run $source master\_script.sh. 

To revert project to completely unprocessed, run $source cleanup.sh. 

python\_scripts: 
------------------
Contains the python scripts that will run the tracking algorithms. 

Note: work in progress, as yet unfinished.
